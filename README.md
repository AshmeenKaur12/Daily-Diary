## 🧠 AI & Machine Learning Training

Welcome to my personal learning log for my journey into **Artificial Intelligence** and **Machine Learning**!  
This repository serves as a daily chronicle of what I’ve explored, built, and reflected on — one step closer to mastering the world of intelligent systems.

## 📅 What You'll Find Here

This repo contains:

- 🗓️ **Daily Logs** — Markdown entries for each day’s learning: concepts, notes, and hands-on code.
- 🔍 **Topics Covered** — From Python basics and Linux to neural networks, NLP, TensorFlow, and more.
- 🧪 **Mini Projects** — Code snippets, experiments, and small real-world applications.
- 📚 **Resources** — Articles, books, videos, and courses I use as references.

## 🌱 Learning Goals

- Master ML fundamentals: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.
- Get hands-on with libraries: **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Scikit-Learn**, **TensorFlow**.
- Build intuition through small projects and code experiments.
- Document not just *what* I learn — but *why* it matters and *how* I plan to apply it.
