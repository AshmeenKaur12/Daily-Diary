## Overview

On **Day 13**, I explored **Linear Regression**, one of the simplest and most important supervised learning algorithms.  
I learned how it maps data points with an optimized linear function to make predictions based on a linear relationship between input and output.

## Key Concepts

- **Definition:** Predict a dependent variable (Y) based on an independent variable (X) using a straight line.
- **Assumption:** Output changes at a constant rate with input.
- **Equation:**  
  - *Simple Linear Regression:* `ŷ = θ₀ + θ₁x`
  - *Multiple Linear Regression:* `ŷ = θ₀ + θ₁x₁ + θ₂x₂ + ⋯ + θₙxₙ`

- **Examples:**  
  - Predicting student exam scores based on hours studied.
  - Real Estate Pricing, Financial Forecasting, Agriculture Yield, E-commerce trends.

## Types of Linear Regression

- **Simple Linear Regression:** One input feature (Univariate).
- **Multiple Linear Regression:** Multiple input features (Multivariate).
