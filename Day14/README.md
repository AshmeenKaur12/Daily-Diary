# Logistic Regression

## Overview

Logistic Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification problems.  
Unlike Linear Regression, which predicts continuous values, Logistic Regression predicts the probability that an input belongs to a specific class.  
It is primarily used for **binary classification**, but it can also handle multiple classes.

Logistic Regression uses the **sigmoid function** (for binary) or **softmax function** (for multinomial) to convert inputs into probability values.

## Types of Logistic Regression

1. **Binomial Logistic Regression**
   - The dependent variable has only two categories (e.g., Yes/No, 0/1).
   - Example use cases: Spam detection, pass/fail prediction.

2. **Multinomial Logistic Regression**
   - The dependent variable has three or more **unordered** categories (e.g., classifying animals into cat, dog, sheep).
   - Uses the softmax function.

3. **Ordinal Logistic Regression**
   - The dependent variable has three or more **ordered** categories (e.g., low, medium, high).
   - Takes the natural order into account.
