# Day 11 — Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

**Date:** July 7, 2025

## Overview
This document summarizes fundamental topics in **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** covered on **Day 11**. It explains the **Confusion Matrix**, key performance metrics, and provides an introduction to **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.

## Topics Covered

### 1️ Confusion Matrix in Machine Learning
- **Definition:** A table to compare predicted vs actual results for evaluating a classification model.
- **Components:**
  - **True Positive (TP)** — Correct positive prediction.
  - **True Negative (TN)** — Correct negative prediction.
  - **False Positive (FP)** — Incorrect positive prediction (**Type I error**).
  - **False Negative (FN)** — Incorrect negative prediction (**Type II error**).

### 2️ Metrics from the Confusion Matrix
- **Accuracy:** `(TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)`
- **Precision:** `TP / (TP + FP)`
- **Recall:** `TP / (TP + FN)`
- **F1-Score:** `2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)`
- **Specificity:** `TN / (TN + FP)`
- **Type I Error Rate:** `FP / (FP + TN)`
- **Type II Error Rate:** `FN / (TP + FN)`

### 3️ Large Language Models (LLMs)
- **Definition:** AI models that use deep learning (transformers) to understand and generate human-like text.
- **Examples:**
  - **GPT-3:** OpenAI’s Generative Pre-trained Transformer.
  - **BERT:** Google’s Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers.
  - **RoBERTa:** Robustly optimized BERT by Facebook AI.
- **Key Features:**
  - Multi-layer architectures (embedding, attention, feed-forward).
  - Trained on large text corpora with self-supervised learning.
  - Capable of zero-shot learning and generalization.

### 4️ Applications of LLMs
- Natural Language Understanding (NLU)
- Conversational AI: Chatbots & Virtual Assistants
- Text Generation & Summarization
- Language Translation
- Sentiment Analysis
- Code Generation

### 5️ AI vs ML: Quick Comparison
| Artificial Intelligence | Machine Learning |
