## ✨ Overview

Today’s focus was on **TensorFlow**, Google’s open-source framework for building and deploying **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Deep Learning (DL)** models at scale.  
TensorFlow makes it easy to design, train, convert, optimize, and run ML models across devices — from powerful servers to mobile and embedded systems.

## 📌 Key Concepts

- ✅ **What is TensorFlow?**
  - Developed by Google Brain for scalable ML & AI.
  - Supports NLP, Computer Vision, Time Series, Reinforcement Learning.

- ✅ **Key Features:**
  - 📈 **Scalability:** From PC to mobile, embedded devices.
  - 🧩 **Ecosystem:** TensorFlow Core, Keras, TFLite, TensorFlow.js, TFX, TensorFlow Hub.
  - 🔄 **Autograd:** Automatic differentiation for backpropagation.
  - 🌐 **Multi-language Support:** Python, C++, Java, JavaScript.
  - ⚙️ **Model Serving & Optimization:** Tools for efficient deployment & serving.

## 🔬 Typical TensorFlow Workflow

1️⃣ **Train a Model**  
- Build & train with TensorFlow or Keras.  
- Use relevant datasets, validate for high accuracy.

2️⃣ **Convert the Model**  
- Use **TFLite Converter** to produce `.tflite` files for edge devices.

3️⃣ **Optimize the Model**  
- Apply quantization, pruning, weight clustering to reduce size and speed up inference.

4️⃣ **Deploy the Model**  
- Deploy `.tflite` models on Android, iOS, Raspberry Pi, microcontrollers.

5️⃣ **Run Inference**  
- Use **TensorFlow Lite Interpreter** for real-time predictions offline on the edge.
