## ðŸ“– Overview

On **Day 2**, I explored the different **types of Machine Learning** and how they are used in real-world applications.  
This entry builds on the basics from Day 1 and dives deeper into how machines learn using different methods.

## ðŸ§© Topics Covered

### ðŸ”¹ 1. Supervised Learning
- **Definition:** Models learn from **labeled datasets** with known input-output pairs.
- **Goal:** Map inputs to correct outputs.
- **Key Tasks:**
  - **Classification:** Predict categories (e.g., spam detection).
  - **Regression:** Predict continuous values (e.g., house prices).

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2. Unsupervised Learning
- **Definition:** Models work with **unlabeled data** to find hidden patterns.
- **Goal:** Discover structures, relationships, or groupings in data.
- **Key Tasks:**
  - **Clustering:** Group similar data points (e.g., customer segmentation).
  - **Association:** Find relationships between variables (e.g., market basket analysis).

### ðŸ”¹ 3. Reinforcement Learning (RL)
- **Definition:** Models learn by interacting with an environment through **trial and error**.
- **Key Idea:** Learn optimal actions using **reward feedback**.
- **Applications:** Self-driving cars, game-playing bots like AlphaGo.

**Common RL Algorithms:**
- **Q-learning:** Learns optimal actions using a Q-function.
- **SARSA:** Similar to Q-learning but updates based on actual actions taken.
- **Deep Q-learning:** Uses deep neural networks to handle complex environments.

**Types of Reinforcement Learning:**
- **Positive Reinforcement:** Rewards for desired actions (e.g., earning points).
- **Negative Reinforcement:** Removing negative stimuli when the desired action is taken (e.g., silencing a buzzer).

## âœ… What I Learned
- Differences between **supervised**, **unsupervised**, and **reinforcement learning**.
- Common use cases for each type.
- How reinforcement learning uniquely relies on feedback from actions.
