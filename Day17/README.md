## Overview

Today I explored **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** — a branch of AI that enables computers to **understand, process, and generate human language**.  
NLP combines computer science, linguistics, and machine learning to unlock value from text and speech data.

## Key NLP Techniques

**1. Text Processing & Preprocessing**  
- **Tokenization:** Splitting text into words or sentences.  
- **Stemming & Lemmatization:** Reducing words to root forms.  
- **Stopword Removal:** Removing common words with little meaning.  
- **Normalization:** Standardizing text (case, punctuation, spelling).

**2. Syntax & Parsing**  
- **POS Tagging:** Identify parts of speech (noun, verb, etc.).  
- **Dependency & Constituency Parsing:** Analyze sentence structure.

**3. Semantic Analysis**  
- **NER:** Recognize names, places, dates.  
- **Word Sense Disambiguation:** Pick correct word meaning.  
- **Coreference Resolution:** Link references to the same entity.

**4. Information Extraction**  
- Extract entities & their relationships.

**5. Text Classification**  
- **Sentiment Analysis, Topic Modeling, Spam Detection**

**6. Language Generation**  
- **Machine Translation, Text Summarization, Text Generation**

**7. Speech Processing**  
- **Speech Recognition, Text-to-Speech (TTS)**

**8. Question Answering**  
- Retrieval-based and Generative QA.

**9. Dialogue Systems**  
- **Chatbots, Virtual Assistants**

**10. Sentiment & Emotion Analysis**  
- **Emotion Detection, Opinion Mining**
