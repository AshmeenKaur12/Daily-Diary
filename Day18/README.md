**Date:** July 16, 2025

## Overview

Today’s focus was on **Sentiment Analysis**, an important **NLP** application used to determine whether text expresses **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral** sentiment — and sometimes even specific emotions like *happy*, *sad*, or *angry*.  
It helps businesses understand customer opinions and manage brand reputation.

## Why is Sentiment Analysis Important?

- **Customer Feedback Analysis:** Identify positive or negative feedback to improve products and services.
- **Brand Reputation Management:** Monitor social media and reviews to protect brand image.
- **Product Development:** Understand what customers love or dislike to guide improvements.
- **Competitor Analysis:** Compare sentiment about your products vs competitors for better strategy.

## How it Works

**1️ Preprocessing:**  
- Clean text (remove HTML, special characters).  
- Tokenization: Split into words/tokens.  
- Remove stopwords (common filler words).  
- Stemming/Lemmatization: Reduce words to base form.

**2️ Feature Extraction & Modeling:**  
- Convert text: Bag-of-Words, Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe).
- Train models with labeled data (positive, negative, neutral).
- Predict sentiment for new text using trained models.

## Approaches

- **Rule-Based:** Use lexicons, count positive/negative words, apply simple rules.
- **Machine Learning:** Train models like Naive Bayes, SVM, HMM, CRF.
- **Neural Networks:** Use RNN, LSTM, GRU to handle sequential text.
- **Hybrid:** Combine rule-based + ML for better accuracy.
